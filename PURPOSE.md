# Purpose

I have another repository, which is called 'archive'.

But that repository is almost about the software development.

However, this repo is gonna contain various topics, not just development.

Most development-related stuffs will be written in English.

Thus that's why this have directories by natural languages.

Since I'm korean, I'm currently planning only English and Korean.
